# Context
- Some keyboards do not have media controls. When I had to downgrade my keyboard, it was highly annoying I couldn't change/pause a song with a click of a button. 
- I wrote the script in the intention to improve Quality of Life with Spotify. The script works okay with Youtube and other media playback, but it was only designed to work with Spotify so there might be bugs outside of that domain.
# Prerequisite
- You need to have an AHK script program installed like: https://www.autohotkey.com/
# How TO INSTALL (Autorun)
- Press "Windows + R" then "shell:startup" without quotation
- Place the AHK script inside of the folder. You are done :)
# How TO USE (Spotify)
- Alt + Left/Right arrows to change songs
- Alt + Spacebar to Pause/Play
- Alt + Up/Down arrows to control volume
