Simple Task Manager I made a few years ago to bypass the restrictions made on some computer systems which blocks both Task Manager and Command Prompt

Nearly all systems I've been on with command prompt restrictions only prevent the ".bat" extension. However, the alternative extension is ".cmd" and seems to work (at least for me)

To use the script, open it up and find the process you want to kill. Have fun

You can use both:
- Process name: discord.exe, firefox.exe etc
- PID: 10420, 2202 etc
